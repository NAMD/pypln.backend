Code Guidelines
---------------

- Use `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
- Commented code is dead code
- Write tests
- Name identifiers with readable names (``x`` is wrong)
- Use new-style formatting (``'{} = {}'.format(a, b)`` instead of
  ``'%s = %s' % (a, b)``)
- All ``#TODO`` should be transformed in issues
- Run all tests before pushing
