Text Parsing and Part-of-Speech Tagging
=======================================

**WARNING:** since we rebuilt our backend, this documentation is depreacted.
Come here in some days and we'll have an updated one.

For text parsing and morphosyntactic analysis, AKA part-of-speech tagging,
**PyPLN** uses mainly **NLTK**, with one exception, for portuguese corpora,
we also use **Palavras**.
