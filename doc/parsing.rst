Text Parsing and Part-of-Speech Tagging
=======================================

For text parsing and morpho-syntactic analysis, AKA part-of-speech tagging,
**PyPLN** uses **NLTK** taggers. Except for Portuguese language, where we use the parser **Palavras**. Due to licensing restrictions,
**Palavras** cannot be distributed with PyPLN, being available only through our web services on PyPLN.org.
